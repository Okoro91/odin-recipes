        <h3>A popular Nigerian Meal Iyan and Efo Riro</h3>
        <p>
            Ẹ̀fọ́ (pronounced “Eh-foh”) is kind of a generic Yorùbá word for leafy vegetables. In Nigeria, you'd probably use pumpkin leaves, amaranth leaves, etc. to make this food with other ingredients and served with Iyan. This stew is delicious…especially when you eat it with your hand, just remember that ours is a right-hand culture!

        <h2>DIRECTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pot on medium-high heat. Season meat with salt, pepper, and coriander, then sear on all sides, and set aside.</li>
            <li>Blend tomatoes, onions, and peppers into a smooth puree, then pour directly into the hot pot. Add palm oil, and stir well. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer.</li>
            <li>Once the oil begins to separate, and the stew darkens, season with additional salt, and add onion powder and coriander. Turn the heat back up to medium-high.</li>
            <li>Add the spinach, and stir. As it wilts, add kale, and stir to encourage the water to evaporate.</li>
            <li>Add the meat from step one, and stir to mix. Turn the heat down to low.</li>
            <li>Transfer yam flour to a large pot or metal bowl, and mix in boiling water until a uniform paste forms. mix continuously to get rid of lumps, and activate the starches so that it becomes slightly “stretchy”.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>And your dellicious meal is ready, plate and serve</p>
